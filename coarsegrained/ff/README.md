Here are the bonded and non-bonded parameters for the complete SPP forming CG FF
This includes the parameters for OH1, OH2, OH3, OH4 beads
 
The pickle file is read in for the bonded coeffs. The tabulated nonbonded potentials are in the folder. Note: HOOMD requires the potentials to be dimensionless, so make sure to use those. Potentials with units are also included for completeness.
